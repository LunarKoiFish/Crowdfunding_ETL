# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this mini project, we are practicing building an ETL pipeline using pandas, python, and regular expressions (regex) to extract and transform data. 

After the data has been transformed, we create csv files and use the csv file data to create ERD and a table schema using pgAdmin. CSV file data will then be imported into the Postgres database.

There was some complications with my laptop when the project was first started. Due to said complications, I was unable to work on this project for a couple weeks. I took on this project by myself even though it was group project.

I was able to complete project with the help of looking through past assignments and activities. Xpert Learning Assistant was also used to correct mistakes I have made and gave me pointers on how I could write my code better to be more organized.
